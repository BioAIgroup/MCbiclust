# MCbiclust

MCbiclust is a R package for running massively correlating biclustering analysis.

The package was originally designed as part of my PhD at UCL to solve a problem in bioinformatics to find biclusters representing different modes of regulation of the mitochondria in disease states.
The same methods however can be used on any gene expression data set to find biclusters of interest.

The techniques and methods in MCbiclust should also be relevent to non biological applications, and have potential for use in machine learning problems.
